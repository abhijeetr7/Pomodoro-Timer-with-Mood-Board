# Pomodoro-Timer-with-Mood-Board

This Pomodoro Timer and Mood Board application helps you stay focused and reflect on your sessions.

Here's a quick overview of what's included:

Pomodoro Timer: A clear, circular timer with a progress bar that counts down your 25-minute work sessions, 5-minute short breaks, and 15-minute long breaks (after every 4 Pomodoros).

Task Input: You can enter the task you're currently working on.

Mood Board: After each Pomodoro session, a modal appears, allowing you to add an image URL or a quote/note to your mood board, along with the associated task and timestamp.

Polaroid Style: Mood board entries are displayed in a visually appealing polaroid style.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, working well on both mobile and desktop.
